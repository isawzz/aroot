  'The necessity of community':
  `We did not develop to live alone. The very fact we humans experience loneliness is as a direct result of us being herd animals, community animals. When we first evolved into our current species, and likely long before, we relied on one another for our survival, being isolated meant being dead. No single person can create anything close to what we have created as a collective. No single person can encompass the vast knowledge stored and spread across humanity. We are strong because we work together. Apes strong together, and we really are just great apes.
  <br>
  This feature of the human species gave rise to empathy, being able to relate to others and feel how they feel. Without empathy, everybody would use and abuse each other relentlessly. And yes these things happen despite our ability to empathize, however clearly a large part of us are really trying to do things right.
  <br>
  We are of course not the only species on this earth with empathy. There are many species who have learned to communicate, work together, and help each other. We are not inherently selfish, we are inherently empathetic and curious. It is a great failing of the modern education system and society as a whole that we are not taught how to help others and ask for help ourselves. 
  <br>
  Instead, we live as individuals, in separate houses, disconnected from the anonymous people we see each day. We are taught that we need to do everything individually, and that anyone who fails to be able to maintain every aspect of their own lives is dysfunctional, broken, or even bad. We walk around houseless people passed out on the street judging them for making “bad choices”, assuming its someone elses job to “take care of them” or even wishing them gone altogether. 
  <br>
  But in a capitalistic society like the one we live in nobody will take care of anyone. Nobody really wants to do their jobs, they feel they have no other choice to survive. Nobody wants to pay taxes, and lose more of their hard earned income and stability. Everybody is taught to hoard their wealth, from the homeless person to the billionaire. Everybody is taught to compete, dominate and control whomever they can, assert their will. Some are societally considered better people, and some worse. Common stereotypes and taboos run rampant, disconnecting people further. We are taught to obey, not how to figure things out together. This is a major flaw with life in this world. 
  <br>
  The thing is, none of us are “better” or “worse” than any other human on this planet. That’s right, youre no better than Hitler, but youre also not worse. People are flawed. ALL people. Women are not “more emotional” than men, we’ve just been trained to express it differently. A man is equally likely to mess up, to get heated and impulsive and aggressive to any woman. 
  <br>
  We are in fact all different, and all the same. Every human is a different mix of likes, dislikes, appearances personalities. There are “manly” women, and womanly men, and trans people, and nonbinary people, as much as you try and deny their existence they are as real and valid humans as anyone else. There is any variation of human you can imagine in existence at any given point, theres 8 billion of us, a number completely incomprehensible. 
  <br>
  And each one of those humans can be or become disabled at any point in there life, and almost everyone does, at the very least when they grow old. As children we are all dependents on others care and help to survive, why is it such a strange concept that when we grow into adults we dont suddenly become completely independent of others. 
  <br>
  We are never completely independent in this society, we are simply disconnected from just how much we depend on that homeless teenager, who may eventually provide great service to the world, with the right support to get them out of that situation. 
  <br>
  Expecting people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, much like the expression itself is impossible and severely misinformed. A person from a privileged position may come to believe they made the right decisions and therefore are a good person, better than the drug addict on the corner of the street, when in fact the only difference is the support you received that they didn’t get. 
  <br>
  Certainly some people require higher levels of support, but what a strange world we live in that a need for help is punished. Anyone can become homeless, you, your mother, your 5th cousin who has a PHD in neuroscience, the neighbor who owns a boat, thinking yourself above people who struggle is an incredibly heartless and inconsiderate thing to do, especially knowing you could very well be in their position in need of that support. 
  <br>
  Just because you currently have funds or friends does not absolve you from being a member of the same society where people needlessly starve and freeze on the streets while 1/3rd of all food produced heads straight to the dumpster, and millions of houses stand empty. If every church in the USA helped one foster child and 75% helped one homeless person, there would be no one left to help. These congregations of hundreds preaching to treat your neighbor as yourself, who have however not managed to help anyone. 
  <br>
  So, with the understanding that organized religion and our government refuse to support all their citizens properly, we must take things into our own hands and organize. 
  <br>
  This app was intended to create an open market for people to express their support needs and capabilities. We are under the firm belief that every human is valuable no matter what or how much they provide the society at large, because our most vulnerable are those who cannot provide and thereby arent valued by the current society and system. 
  <br>
  Everybody can provide services, even just an ear to listen, a shared experience, or whatever else. It is also clear that helping others when you are capable makes life far more fulfilling, and the more you help the more others will be able to help and function in their own ways to enrich our society through any number of ways we cannot even imagine as single humans with knowledge and understanding limited to one brain and one persons lived experiences. We all benefit from helping and being helped, and it appears to us that there are systems in place to actively hinder our ability to do so, and actively create discord to make enemies of each other. 
  <br>
  Life doesn’t have to be about competition, it could be about cooperation and everyone would be better off for it. We wouldnt need to hoard our wealth because we know it was actually being used to help people, and everyone could get the support they need without having to prove themselves as more than just alive- because every living person deserves the help they need to have a bearable existence.  <br>
